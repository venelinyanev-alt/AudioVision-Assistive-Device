# AudioVision: ESP32-Based Assistive Device for the Visually Impaired

Project Overview
An open-source assistive device that uses computer vision and AI to help visually impaired individuals navigate their environment. The device describes the world around them through audio feedback.

Hardware Architecture
Master Unit: ESP32-S3 development board (handles user interaction, AI communication, and audio output)

Vision Unit: ESP32-CAM module (captures high-quality images based on master commands)

Communication: High-speed SPI interface between Master and Vision units for minimal latency

Audio: INMP441 I2S microphone for wake-word detection and MAX98357A I2S amplifier for clear speech output

Display: I2C OLED display (SSD1306) for settings configuration and system status feedback

Key Features
Voice-controlled operation with wake-word detection

Real-time image capture and AI-based description

Audio feedback through high-quality speech synthesis

Visual interface for configuration and status monitoring
